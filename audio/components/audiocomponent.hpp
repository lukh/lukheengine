/**
 * \brief   This is the abstraction Class for all users audio components
  \verbatim

  This abstraction class should be used for each audio component the user want to implement
  It handles a 2 channels (stereo) stream, with one input and one output buffer.
  Each buffer is interleaved (framesize = 2) and contain L/R samples

  User has to implement process, the audio stream processing method
  and update should be implemented to update component parameters, decide by the user.
  The process method will be call by the Engine each time it's needed by the Driver.
