/**
 * \brief   Track implement a simple way to handle and route audio stream.
  Track inherits of AudioComponent, and is called by a process.

  It has stereo input and output, defined by id (like an audio component)

  It contains an array of AudioComponent*, which define the Track.

  The first AudioComponent will handle the input stream and the output stream
  The others components will handle the last output as an input

  Then, it is possible to create a Real Track, with a (for instance) sound generator (without using in buffer) and FX
  or only FX

  An AudioComponent in a Track doesn't care about its mInStereoCh and mOutStereoCh, because the
  Track::process() give directly the right buffer.
