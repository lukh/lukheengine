  It handles and ask components for processing, depending on their channels, and order.
  It controlled by the AudioDriver, through AbstractAudioDriver::process()

  The Engine::process method calls process methods of each AudioComponent,
  given in and out interleaved stereo buffer. These buffers are returned dependending on
  AudioComponent::mInStereoCh, AudioComponent::mOutStereoCh

  The Engine::process() method will, for each component :

  > select stereo buffers (in and out, 2ch interleaved) from the driver
 (throught AbstractAudioDriver::getBuffer)
  depending on the channels needed by the component (AudioComponent::getInStereoCh(), AudioComponent::getOutStereoCh() )

  > call the AudioComponent::process of the component, with the buffers given.
